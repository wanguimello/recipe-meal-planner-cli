## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, ensure you have [Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) installed. Then, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
pipenv install
```

This command will create a virtual environment and install all required packages defined in the `Pipfile`.

## Usage

To start the CLI application, run the following command:

```bash
pipenv run python src/cli.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to navigate through the menu options and manage your recipes and meal plans.

## CLI Script

### `cli.py`

This is the main entry point of the application. The CLI script presents users with a menu to interact with the application. It provides options to create, view, delete, and find recipes and meal plans.

#### Key Functions:
- `display_menu()`: Displays the main menu options to the user.
- `add_recipe()`: Prompts the user to enter recipe details and saves it to the database.
- `view_recipes()`: Fetches and displays all saved recipes.
- `delete_recipe()`: Allows the user to delete a recipe by its ID.
- `find_recipe()`: Searches for a recipe by its ID and displays its details.

The script continuously runs until the user chooses to exit, ensuring an interactive experience. Input validation is implemented to handle erroneous data entry gracefully.

## Functions

### `helpers.py`

This utility module contains several helper functions that facilitate various tasks throughout the application.

- `validate_recipe_name(name)`: Validates that the recipe name is a non-empty string.
- `format_ingredient_list(ingredients)`: Returns a formatted string of ingredients for display.
- `calculate_servings(ingredient_quantity, serving_size)`: Calculates the number of servings based on ingredient quantity and serving size.
- `load_recipes_from_file(file_path)`: Loads recipes from a JSON file and returns them as a list.
- `handle_error(error_message)`: Prints an error message and exits the program.

### `setup.py`

Responsible for initializing the database connection and creating the necessary tables. It ensures that the database schema is set up correctly before any operations are performed.

## Models

### `recipe.py`

Defines the `Recipe` model, which represents a recipe in the application. It includes attributes such as:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the recipe.
- `name`: Name of the recipe.
- `ingredients`: List of ingredients required for the recipe.
- `instructions`: Step-by-step instructions to prepare the recipe.

The model includes ORM methods for CRUD operations, ensuring that recipes can be added, retrieved, updated, and deleted from the database.

### `ingredient.py`

Defines the `Ingredient` model, representing individual ingredients used in recipes. Attributes include:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the ingredient.
- `name`: Name of the ingredient.
- `quantity`: Quantity of the ingredient.

### `meal_plan.py`

Defines the `MealPlan` model, which allows users to organize their recipes into meal plans. It contains attributes like:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the meal plan.
- `recipes`: List of recipe IDs associated with the meal plan.
- `date`: Date for which the meal plan is created.
